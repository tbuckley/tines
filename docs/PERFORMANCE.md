# Navigation performance

Two measurements, one modelled and one real.

## Modelled: `pnpm --filter web perf:nav`

`apps/web/src/lib/server/api/nav-perf.test.ts` runs the real route `load`
functions against the migration-backed in-memory DB with a fixed artificial
latency (20 ms) on every statement. Because the latency dominates, wall-clock ÷
20 ms ≈ the number of **sequential D1 round-trip waves** on the critical path —
which is what actually sets navigation time on a Worker talking to D1.

It is excluded from `pnpm test` (it spends seconds sleeping); `perf:nav` sets
`NAVPERF=1` to opt in and prints `/tmp/navperf.txt` afterwards.

- `NAVPERF_SERIALIZE=1` forces Kysely's connection mutex back on, reproducing
  the pre-`ConcurrentD1Dialect` baseline — that is how before/after numbers for
  a fan-out change are produced.
- `NAVPERF_OUT=<path>` redirects the report (vitest 4 swallows `console.log`
  from test files, hence the file).

20 ms is a modelling constant, not measured D1 latency: trust the **ratios**,
not the absolute milliseconds.

## Real: `Server-Timing`

`hooks.server.ts` appends `Server-Timing: auth;dur=<ms>, app;dur=<ms>` to every
response — `auth` is the Better Auth session resolve, `app` the whole handler.
Visible per request in DevTools → Network → Timing on any deployment, with no
OTel plumbing. (`kit.experimental.tracing` would need an exporter on Workers;
that is a project of its own.)

## Baseline, 2026-08-29 (Tines/32)

Sequential waves per page, modelled, before and after lifting the D1 connection
mutex:

| Page | Queries | Waves before | Waves after |

| `/issues/[project]/[number]` | 26 | 29.1 | 6.8 |
| `/agents` | 10 | 11.2 | 2.3 |
| `/context` | 6 | 6.8 | 2.2 |
| `/issues` | 5 | 5.7 | 2.4 |
| `/projects` | 4 | 4.5 | 2.3 |
| `/activity` | 2 | 2.2 | 1.2 |
